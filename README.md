# Employee Tracker

## Technoligies Used

- Node.js
- Inquirer
- MySQL

## Description

The Employee Management CLI is a command-line application that allows you to manage departments, roles, and employees within your organization. With this application, you can perform various tasks like viewing and adding departments, roles, and employees, as well as updating employee roles.

For this project, I employed SQL in conjunction with the MySQL shell to create an employee tracking system. This application leverages direct SQL queries to enable any business proprietor to effectively monitor their departments, each identified by a name and ID. Within these departments, various roles are defined, encompassing attributes such as title, salary, and department ID. Furthermore, each role corresponds to multiple employees, with each employee being uniquely identified by an ID and featuring attributes such as first name, last name, role ID, and manager ID.
